        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

            "Agent Response: RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a technique used in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance their performance by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. The core idea behind RAG is to improve the quality and relevance of generated text by incorporating external information retrieved from a large corpus of documents.\n",

            "### Key Components of RAG:\n",
            "1. **Retriever**: This component searches a large corpus of documents to find relevant information based on the input query.\n",

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This means that the information from the retrieved documents is combined with the original query to provide more context and relevant information.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model (e.g., GPT-3, BERT), uses the augmented input to generate a response. The generative model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant answers because it has access to additional information from the retrieval step.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the language model needs to generate responses based on a large and diverse set of information, such as in open-domain question answering, customer support, and knowledge-based systems. By leveraging both retrieval and generation, RAG can provide more accurate and informative responses compared to using a generative model alone.\""

It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This can involve concatenating the retrieved information with the original query or using it to provide additional context.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model (e.g., GPT-3, BERT), uses the augmented input to generate a response. The generative model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant answers because it has access to the additional information retrieved in the first step.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to generate responses based on a large and diverse set of information, such as in open-domain question answering, customer support, and conversational AI. By leveraging both retrieval and generation, RAG can provide more accurate and informative responses compared to using a generative model alone.\",\n",

The key features of QLoRA include:\\n\\n1. **Memory Efficiency**: It allows finetuning of a 65 billion parameter model on a single 48GB GPU.\\n2. **Performance Preservation**: Maintains full 16-bit finetuning task performance.\\n3. **Innovations**:\\n   - **4-bit NormalFloat (NF4)**: A new data type optimal for normally distributed weights.\\n   - **Double Quantization**: Reduces memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants.\\n   - **Paged Optimizers**: Manages memory spikes during training.\\n\\nThe approach involves backpropagating gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters (LoRA). The best model family developed using QLoRA, named Guanaco, outperforms previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, achieving 99.3% of ChatGPT's performance with only 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU.\\n\\n### Technical Papers on QLoRA\\n\\n1. **Title**: [QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314)\\n   - **Authors**: Tim Dettmers, Artidoro Pagnoni, Ari Holtzman, Luke Zettlemoyer\\n   - **Summary**: This paper presents QLoRA, detailing its memory-saving innovations and performance benchmarks.
